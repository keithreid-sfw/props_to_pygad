gcc compiler
C
python

python libraries:

base:      ctypes, random, timeit
non base:  numpy, scipy

C code written on codeblocks
Python 3.8 or 3.9 written on Ubuntu, Arch linux distros

compilation advice
this is more or less repeated in the python code

in Linux:

     precompile with bash script
     then run ldconfig

     if your computer has issues you may need to reconfgure the PATH used to find libraries

 <my_computer/Projects/Machine_Learning$>>> $ gcc -fPIC -shared -o keith_functions.so keith_module.c
 <my_computer/Projects/Machine_Learning$>>> $ sudo ldconfig -v

 note that printf
 when called from keith_mutate over in C land
 prints out to the terminal you are using to run your IDE, not to the notebook here
